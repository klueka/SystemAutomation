This backup program was made to automate my folder/files into a zip file. This is an initial rough draft. I still neeed to add error exceptions and test the features. Although it is currently working for me.

To run this program download the files into a user directory you are currently using. This program is based off what user you are signed in as (It gathers the current running user and that is what builds the paths). 
So you could download these files anywhere and run it, as long as your logged as the desired user. 
Then once downloaded, run the following in the command line
'python main.py' or 'python3 main.py'
